#Why are there two scripts?
##The original scripts were made to run Freesurfer on Mac/Linux operating system. So, there were some errors when these scripts were run on other operating systems. 
##These files on the GitHub repository will come in handy if you are running Freesurfer on the windows operating system. So, if you are running Freesurfer on Mac/Linux operating system then you must use the original scripts.  
##Freesurfer is an application that is made for Mac operating system, so if you want to run it on windows, you have to run it in a docker container. Download the docker desktop from this URL: (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). 
##To run these scripts on windows you have to download Gitbash from the URL: (https://git-scm.com/download/win). And then run these scripts through Gitbash. 
##The original shell scripts were not running on the windows computer, as they were made on a mac operating system. So, some changes were to be made. First, we had to add winpty, it is a windows-based software package that provides an interface similar to Unix. The syntax for binding was changed by adding an extra slash (/) in the command after usr, to make it functional in windows. The following is an example for the two changes that were made. 
##The original script: 
###docker exec -it -w /usr/local/freesurfer/myfiles enigma-cnv-freesurfer sh 1a_enigma_runfreesurfer_loop.sh /usr/local/freesurfer/myfiles
##The changed script: 
###winpty docker exec -it -w //usr/local/freesurfer/myfiles enigma-cnv-freesurfer sh 1a_enigma_runfreesurfer_loop.sh //usr/local/freesurfer/myfiles
##We had to choose an EOL conversion to finish making the scripts Unix friendly by using the Unix(LF) option in Notepad ++. Once this is done, the scripts are ready to be used with Windows.
